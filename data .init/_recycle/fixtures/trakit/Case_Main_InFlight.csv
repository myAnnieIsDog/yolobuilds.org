Mr. Kyber has 2 shuttle buses, with the interiors removed in order to have housing built inside. He also has 5 unattached travel trailers in a row next to his house that are very visible from the road and also from our property. They are in various stages of disrepair and have electricity supplied by extension cords. Some have people staying in them. He also has a 6th unattached trailer that recently was almost caught on fire during a controlled burn down further on his property. The burned plastic is coming off and is littering adjacent properties. The final straw for me was when he towed a bright red abandoned camper van left behind after a mentally ill resident abandoned it, to the creek area, right on the fence line of my property. He dumped the van in the creek. When asked if he could remove it, he told me he means it to be a yoga and retreat space. If Mr Kyber is running a rental business or a campground he should be declaring these trailers on personal property tax, and obtaining the appropriate conditional use permit. If not, he should remove them.","DAWNE KORANDA","","COURTESY NOTICE","0","0","0","","","","KYBER DAKOTA HARLAN","","","DBK:2206151235230818","","YOLO:11021013292236589","","","","","","0","00000000AD676574","2879480792","0","","","","","",""
