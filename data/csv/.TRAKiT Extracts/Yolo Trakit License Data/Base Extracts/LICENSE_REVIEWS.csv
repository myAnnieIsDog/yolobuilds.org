"11602","SHERIFF","2012-07-06 00:00:00","","MARTIN TORRES","","(7/6/2012 5:14 PM KAP)Hey Krista-Undersheriff had an adverse contact with this gentleman on July 3 when he started to set up his stand at CR89 and SR16 without a permit. US Lopez contacted the guy and asked if he had this permit. The guy first blew him off but then asked Tom who he thought he was. Tom identified himself and again asked nicely. The contact went downhill from there but eventually ended with the guy saying he was going to get a permit and be right back. This guy obviously has no respect for law enforcement or other’s property since as of July 3, he didn’t have permission from the property owner to be there before starting to set up. He was extremely uncooperative with Tom even after Tom showed him his Department ID. He gives the impression that he is a hot temper who won’t play well with others who want to play in the same sandbox on that corner. He seemed to the Undersheriff to have a volatile temper so we really don’t welcome the potential the trouble or offer support of this permit. We also do not support approval of this based on his not having permission to be on the site of the location listed on the permit – CR89 at SR16.So – where do we go from here? Would you like something more formal?Larry ________________________________________From: Krista Piazza Sent: Friday, July 06, 2012 12:08 PMTo: Larry CecchettiniSubject: FW: Business License application - Eagle River Native ShirtsFrom: Krista Piazza Sent: Friday, July 06, 2012 12:08 PMTo: Martin TorresSubject: Business License application - Eagle River Native ShirtsPlease review and comment.
