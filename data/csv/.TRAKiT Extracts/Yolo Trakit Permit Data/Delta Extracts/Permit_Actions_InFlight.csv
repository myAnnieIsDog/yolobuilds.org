The amount went from $470,000 to $300,000. The applicants had accidentally used the valuation for the entire project on site that was not included in the scope of work of the project submitted. They had also filled out the application incorrectly to only include the 2,200 sqft portion for Starbucks, and left out the 1,580 sqft for the  Retail Suite connected to it. A refund request has been submitted. For the refund, we are only taking the fees below into consideration: Calgreen, Disabled Access, Plan Review and Title 24 since the other fees are flat fees and not dependent on the project valuation. The original fees paid were in the amount of $5,396.18; refer to Receipt # E1960. With the adjusted amount using the new project valuation of $300,000, the difference is $1,362.31.

Receipt #E4899 in the amount of $233.20.Since the transaction occurred late at night, Pacific Time, it did not settle due to the time difference of Converge which is in East Coast Time.  Seeing that the transaction did not settle, a fiscal employee determined that the transaction had been declined and requested a permit technician to unpay the transaction in TRAKiT, therefore eliminating the sales record history.In order to make sure that the customer received the services they paid for, in corroboration with fiscal management, the transaction was placed back into TRAKiT so that the permit can be issued and the credit card information can be recorded to the GL.  Unfortunately, due to the differing accounting periods, there will be a variance of $233.20 between the GL and the bank for credit card transactions in September that washes out in October.","","VA:2110181117228402","","0","000000009F2E7E0E","2670624268","","0"
