I can use 11x17 paper - that's great.     Thanks for the info about the stoves. I'll take them out.     As for taking so much time, as I'd said, Environmental Health just got back to me at the end of last week. And now the staff person on my case is on vacation and won't be back until next week. I still haven't received all the information he sent me about adapting the plumbing for the shower to meet his codes. I had to wait to hear from Environmental Health before I could do anything else. I had submitted my plans to them immediately after your visit out here with Mr. Butler. I can't finish this until I receive the information from Env. Health and figure out what I'm going to do about the shower in the back building. But since the staff person will be back next week, I hope to be able to finish the shower issue soon after that, depending on how fast any worker I have to hire to do the work can complete it and how fast Env. Health can approve it. I hope this plan is OK with you and your department. You did advise me to go to Environmental Health, and that's what I've done and I'm still working with them.

The letter explained and revealed a number of things about the property, and more specifically the history of the guest house, which were previously unknown to me. I appreciate the information, much of which frankly would appear to have been deliberately withheld from me by the previous owners during the escrow process. Your letter to Don Guthrie also mentioned a deadline of July 8th to submit as-built plans and pay all applicable fees. As this is only two working days hence, I'd like to request a 60 day extension in order to take into account the situation, in light of these new facts. Thank you, and please feel free to contact me here at this email address and/or on my cell phone (530) 613-3485.regardsJeffrey Clark","","GG:1307050749500009","","1895649637","000000000C7FD94C","209705292","","1895649637"
